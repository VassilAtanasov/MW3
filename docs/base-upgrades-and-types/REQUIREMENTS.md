# Requirements — Base upgrades and types

> One phase of iterative development, mirroring the Workflowy level-2 project of the same name
> (`1dd3b0f977af`). This file is the source of product truth for the phase; `/kickoff <feature>`
> turns each FR below into a GitHub issue with acceptance criteria.

## 1. Product goal

Phase 3 is the first real decision. Phase 2 made the game a loop, but every match it produces is
the same match, because the only choice a player ever makes is *where* to send half a garrison.
This phase adds the choice Mushroom Wars 2 is actually built on: spending units on your own bases
instead of at your enemy.

Three things arrive together, and none of them works without the others. Garrisons gain a
**capacity cap**, so a base stops growing on its own and the economy stops being a free ramp. Bases
gain **levels**, bought with units from that base's own garrison, raising both its production rate
and its cap. And a second **base type** appears — a tower, which produces nothing and shoots enemy
armies passing within its range. Because units are finite and can be burned on infrastructure,
"attack now or grow first" becomes a genuine trade-off rather than a foregone conclusion.

The tower deliberately reverses a phase 2 rule: armies are no longer inert once launched (D-15,
phase 2 FR-4). An army can lose units in transit and be destroyed before it ever arrives. That is
the single largest change to the simulation this phase makes, and it is made on purpose rather than
discovered mid-build.

The AI learns to make the same trade-offs, so a match is won or lost for a reason rather than by
arithmetic. Rules stay in the engine-free `MW3.Core` and stay headlessly testable; presentation
stays deliberately plain — shapes and numbers, plus the minimum that makes a level, a cap, a type,
a range, and a transit loss legible. This phase adds **depth to the one match, not breadth**: no
second map, no campaign, no art.

## 2. Target users

- **The player** — the developer, on their own Android device, playing a match that now has more
  than one kind of decision in it. The question this phase answers for them is no longer "can I
  finish a match" (phase 2 settled that) but "did I lose because of something I chose".
- **The developer** — still the implementer, and still the reason every rule must be verifiable
  headlessly. No second human enters the picture this phase either.

## 3. Success criteria

Observable outcomes, not features:

1. A match can be played on a physical Android device in which the player upgrades a base, converts
   a base to a tower and back, and sees an enemy army shot down in transit — with no crash and no
   dead end.
2. Two matches played from the identical starting state diverge because of investment choices
   alone: a player who upgrades early and one who attacks early reach measurably different board
   states, provable headlessly.
3. The whole of the new simulation runs headlessly in tests — caps, production rates, upgrade and
   convert commands, tower fire, transit losses, army destruction, capture demotion, and the
   extended AI — with no graphics device and no wall-clock dependency.
4. Determinism (D-12) survives the reversal: replaying the same commands against the same starting
   state produces the same outcome, every time, including which armies were shot down and when.
5. The AI is not trivially beatable by upgrading — a headless match against a human that upgrades
   its base and turtles does not hand the human a free win.
6. `qa-verifier` confirms each feature unattended through the existing `--script` / `--dump-state` /
   `--screenshot` mechanisms (D-17), without a new verification mechanism being invented.
7. `./gate.ps1` passes locally and in CI throughout, and `MW3.Core` still contains no engine type.

## 4. Functional requirements

Acceptance conditions are intentionally empty here — `/kickoff <feature>` settles them with the
user and writes them into both the Workflowy note and the GitHub issue.

FR-1 (wf: 4ec5d7b58f7c): The developer can cap a base's self-production, give bases a level, and
spend units from a base's own garrison to raise that level, so that growth becomes finite and
investment becomes possible. Core only; draws nothing.

FR-2 (wf: bea15b8431a8): The player can tap a base they own to open an action menu laid out around
it, see each action's unit cost, see an unaffordable action greyed out, dismiss the menu by tapping
elsewhere, and upgrade the base from it — with the base's level and cap visible on the map. This is
the game's first real UI widget; the convert options join it in FR-5.

FR-3 (wf: ace16ed72ce6): The developer can convert an owned base between producer and tower in
either direction at a cost in units, where a tower holds and defends a garrison but produces
nothing, so that the second base type exists as rules. Core only; shooting is FR-4's job.

FR-4 (wf: b7427e502078): The developer can have a tower fire on enemy armies passing within its
range, removing units from them in transit and destroying them outright when their count reaches
zero, so that towers do something and armies stop being inert. Core only; this is the phase's
deliberate reversal of phase 2 FR-4, and it touches the elimination rule (D-20).

FR-5 (wf: b6e8bc28daa9): The player can convert a base from the action menu in both directions, see
a tower drawn distinguishably from a producer, see a tower's range on screen, and watch an army's
count shrink as it is shot in transit — so that everything FR-3 and FR-4 added is visible and
reachable. Adds no rule of its own.

FR-6 (wf: 7eea0544b808): The player can face an AI opponent that upgrades its bases, builds and
un-builds towers, and stops pouring production into a capped base, so that the new decisions are
decisions the opponent also makes. Extends phase 2's three-clause brain rather than replacing it.

### Tuning values — proposed, not decided

Every number below is a **starting proposal for `/kickoff` to confirm or change**, not a settled
requirement. They are recorded here so build mode never has to invent one, and so that the shape of
the constant tables (D-22) is concrete during feature kickoff:

| Level | Garrison cap | Ticks per unit produced | Cost to reach this level | Tower fire period | Tower range (normalized) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 20 | 10 | — (starting level) | 12 ticks | 0.12 |
| 2 | 35 | 7 | 10 units | 8 ticks | 0.15 |
| 3 | 50 | 5 | 20 units | 5 ticks | 0.18 |

Plus: conversion between producer and tower costs 10 units in either direction, and a tower shot
removes 1 unit from the army it hits. Whether three levels is the right ladder length is itself a
kickoff question.

## 5. Non-functional requirements

Only the ones that genuinely constrain design:

- **Determinism remains a hard requirement** (D-12, S-8), and this phase is where it is hardest to
  keep. Tower fire happens continuously against a moving target, which is exactly the shape of
  problem that invites a wall-clock read or a float accumulator. It resolves as integer arithmetic
  on whole ticks like everything else (D-24), or it is wrong.
- **The reversal is a reversal, and must be recorded as one.** Phase 2's FR-4 states plainly that
  armies are inert in flight, and its `REQUIREMENTS.md` §6 scopes interception out. FR-4 of this
  phase contradicts both deliberately. The phase-2 documents are **corrected in place**, in the
  same PR, the way FR-6 corrected FR-3 and FR-5 last phase — never left to read as still-true.
- **Unattended verifiability without new mechanisms.** `--script`, `--dump-state`, and
  `--screenshot` (D-17) already carry everything this phase needs: an action menu is opened by
  `down`/`up` on a base and then on a button, and levels, types, caps, and army counts are dump
  fields. If a feature seems to need a new QA mechanism, that is a signal the design put a decision
  somewhere untestable — fix the design.
- **The engine-free rules layer still binds** (S-2, D-2). Levels, caps, types, tower geometry, and
  the AI's new clauses all live in `MW3.Core` with no `Microsoft.Xna` type, `Vector2` included.
- **Per-frame allocation still matters** (D-13). Tower fire evaluates every tower against every
  in-flight army each tick; the naive implementation allocates a collection per tick per tower on a
  phone. It must not.
- **Cost and speed of the build/run loop** remain the primary constraint (S-5): `dotnet` commands
  only, free CI, no engine binary, no paid runner.
- **Device QA is available and device criteria are blocking.** Follow-up #28 (the MI Pad 4 showing
  as `unauthorized` in `adb`, which left every device criterion on phase 2's #24 and #25 reported
  *not verifiable*) was resolved and closed on 28-07-2026; `adb devices` now shows
  `43e75e5 device`. Device-dependent criteria are therefore verified per feature and block the PR,
  as they have since the device arrived. One lesson from clearing #28 binds every feature this
  phase: an `adb install` attempted while the device was unauthorized **silently no-opped**, so
  device checks ran against a stale APK and produced a convincing false defect. Rebuild and
  reinstall from `main` before trusting any device observation that contradicts a passing headless
  test.
- **A full match is still thousands of ticks**, so `--time-scale` (phase 2 FR-7) remains the lever
  that keeps desktop scripts inside their budget, and Android device checks remain real-time.
- No auth, no persistence, no network, and no accessibility or performance targets this phase.

## 6. Out of scope

Explicit non-goals for this phase — these are what stop `/autopilot` drifting:

- **A third base type.** Producer and tower, and nothing else. No forge, no watchtower, no wall, no
  building that grants an ability — MW2 has several; this phase earns two.
- **Tribe abilities, a rage meter, and any active power** the player triggers outside a base.
- **Unit types.** One unit, as phase 2 established. Levels change how fast units appear and how many
  fit, never what they are.
- **A send-strength picker.** Phase 2 fixed a send at half the garrison rounded down, minimum 1, and
  scoped a slider out; MW2's `25/50/75/100%` control is deliberately **not** taken this phase, even
  though the menu widget FR-2 introduces would make it easy to add. It is a separate decision about
  how the game plays, and it deserves its own phase rather than riding in on a UI feature.
- **A second map, a map file format, and map selection.** Still one hardcoded six-base layout — now
  with more that can happen on it.
- **Campaign structure**: no level list, progression, stars, score, statistics, or save data.
- **Art, sound, music, and animation.** A tower is a different shape or tint, not a model. Original
  art (D-5) still arrives in its own phase.
- **Anything server, account, login, or multiplayer** (S-7).
- **Randomized combat and difficulty levels** (D-15). Tower fire is deterministic integer damage,
  not a hit chance. AI tuning surfaces stay out, as does a switch to disable the AI — refused in
  phase 2 for the same reason it would be refused now.
- **A defence bonus from levels.** Settled in discovery: a level buys production rate and cap only,
  and combat stays phase 2's plain 1:1 arithmetic. This keeps every existing combat test meaning
  exactly what it meant.
- **Army recall, rally points, and interception by armies.** FR-4 makes armies vulnerable to
  *towers* specifically. Armies still do not fight each other in transit, still cannot be recalled,
  and still travel base-to-base in a straight line — no pathfinding, no fog of war.
- **Repair, decay, and over-cap bleed.** Settled in discovery: the cap is a production ceiling, so
  arrivals stack above it freely and nothing decays back down.
- **Nice-to-have, explicitly deferred rather than forgotten**: a HUD totalling a player's units,
  pause, camera pan/zoom, and the app icon still owed from phase 1.

## 7. Open questions

None. Discovery closed with every question resolved.
